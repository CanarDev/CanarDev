## Project Description
In this project, I'm creating an artwork rotation system where a new artwork will be displayed every 3 days. Each piece of art represents a unique perspective, theme, or style, adding variety and visual appeal to any space. Through this project, I aim to explore the intersection of art and technology, showcasing the beauty of different artistic creations while leveraging programming to automate the rotation process.
