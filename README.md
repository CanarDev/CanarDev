# Hi, I'm Vincent ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software sorcerer with a knack for conjuring up cool stuff.
Currently spellbinding folks at [GRAUW.](https://grauw.fr), I'm well-versed in web development, mobile sorcery, and even
a bit of data spelunking.

### Project Description

In this project, I'm creating an artwork rotation system where a new artwork will be displayed every 3 days. Each piece
of art represents a unique perspective, theme, or style, adding variety and visual appeal to any space. In addition, I
duplicate the picture in ASCII mode, infusing a digital twist into the artistic rotation system. Through this project, I
aim to explore the intersection of art and technology, showcasing the beauty of different artistic creations while
leveraging programming to automate the rotation process.
